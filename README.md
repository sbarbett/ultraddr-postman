# ultraddr-postman

This repository contains a set of sample requests for the UDDR API.

## JSON File

The collection export can be found under src/UDDR.postman_collection.json. Similarly, there's an example environment under src/UDDR-example.postman_environment.json. Import these to Postman:

1. Go to **File**
2. Select **Import**
3. Drag the files to the application

## Authentication

Your API key is stored in your environment file as the `api_key` parameter. This key will be appended to each request as the `X-API-Key` header.

## Resources

The collection is organized into folders, each representing a base resource. Each folder has it's own documentation which describes the specific resource and its endpoints.

## Contributions

We welcome and appreciate contributions to this Postman collection! You can help by improving existing requests, adding new ones, or enhancing documentation. Please feel free to submit changes directly through pull requests or contact us with your suggestions.
